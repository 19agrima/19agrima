## About me👋
Hi, I’m Agrima, a Python-focused developer learning data analysis and applied AI. I work with Jupyter Notebook and SQL to explore and analyze data, and I build backend APIs using Flask. I’m also gaining experience with deep learning and computer vision using OpenCV, and I enjoy working with real-world data to turn it into useful insights and applications.
